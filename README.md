# E2E tests for Todo app

UI tests for Todo app is developed via the popular **Cypress**[https://www.cypress.io/] Javascript e2e framework. The tests are accomplished by following best practises and enterprise regulations.

# Steps to execute tests and generate report tool

Navigate to todo folder:

1. `npm install` - to install dependencies
2. `npm start` - to start application on localhost
3. `npx cypress open ` - to open Cypress and execute tests. (choose E2E testing ==> choose one of the browsers ==> and click e2e.cy.js file )
4. `npx cypress run --reporter mochawesome` - to generate nice reporting tool and video by Mocha.

# Detected bug

While doing manual testing, I detected a bug. Therefore, when user puts a text which has more than 100 characters, it will exceed the window screen and user will not be able to submit the task. I put a test sample for that. The execution time for this test will be 17seconds and it will automatically fail and it will be presented in the generated report. The report is located in the **mochawesome-report** folder (copy **mochawesome.html** file in browser). Also, reporting tool has a nice feature of capturing video test cases exection. The video is located in the **videos** folder.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
